1;2899;ford;se;2011;clean vehicle;190552;silver;;166951262;tennessee; usa;6 days left;" I bought mine 4/17 with 98K. Have been wanting a V6 5-sp, '05-'09 vintage for years. The engine is fine. Sounds good. Great mileage. Good power. I pride myself on smooth take-off and gear changes, but this is the orneriest transmission I've ever used! The difference between idle and 4000 rpm is about 1/8"" on the gas pedal, so starting-out without either stalling or way over-revving takes a LOT of finesse. Gear changes are very difficult to master smoothly without lurching. The ride is very harsh with a lot of road noise, which I suppose goes with a quasi high-performance car. My '01 S-10 is quieter and smoother. All that said, it's a smokin' hot looking car, and still fun to drive. This was the first-off of the modern 'Stangs. Hopefully these problems have been ironed-out since."

Well 80k miles later the engine starts having this knocking noise and significant loss of power and not because I don't take care of my car as I changed my oil every 3K miles and keep it very well maintained. After Ford looked at the car they quoted me $4,100 to fix what they called a cam phaser issue (pumps oil to the top end of the motor). Needless to say I pulled the car from Ford and took to a performance shop, who said it needed a new motor for $4,800. Well thats great but this is not my toy its my daily driver. Long story short before you buy research cam phasers this appears to be an issue in many Ford

Its faster, better looking, and really just more of a car than any used BMW/mercedes within its pricing segment.  The only comparable competitor in the used car market this years Mustang has is in the 350z, which handles better but lacks in practicality.  And on top of that, the Z doesn't sound as good as the 8 and after test driving could be a nightmare as a daily driver

Even though I bought the car for my daughter, I do get to drive it when it needs gas. Which isn't that often since the peppy V6 gets 18-20mpg in town & 26-30 mpg on the road.

It was 11 years old with only 22,800 miles on it. I had to see it to believe it. It was so beautiful.   Black  with red leather interior. I purchased the vehicle on site after a test drive of course. This is my 4th mustang and my third convertible. I am addicted to the mustangs. This model does remind me of my 1969 Grande  coupe I had. The lumbar support is a definite improvement for the lower back on this 2006 GT premium. This was a problem in my previous mustangs for longer trips over an hour or so. The pick up in acceleration is fantastic. I agree Ford should cut back on the plastics in the interior because it cheapens the vehicle.  I have a shaker 1000 system and it sounds really good. The cd player is garbage. The first cd I placed in it got stuck. I get plenty of looks and compliments all the time on her. This is a good cruiser car and the family and I enjoy the ride tremendously. Top down rolling down the highway is so soothing and therapeutic. I had a 2002 convertible and 2004 convertible and using the convertible top is a breeze on these newer models than the previous models. The top seems to completely fall into place without effort and you just lock it down with the lighter handles. I would have been great to have power passenger seat. I believe the passenger seat is too low and should have a power package or at least a manual lever to raise the seat or lower the seat and give lumbar support. The rear seats seem comfortable enough.  For a convertible, it is roomier than the Mercedes, jaguar and camaro.  The camaro does not compare. If you really look around, you can see more variations of mustangs by mustang owners than camaros. If you have a mustang, you can almost totally redesign the mustang to your personal needs with all the parts and accessories the  market have available for mustangs.  These have been very reliable. The previous fox body styles, 1999 - 2004 did have this seal leak between the transmission and engine that was annoying after about 90,000 miles and it was not a cheap fix. I am praying these new mach 1 body styles do not such flaws.  I have noticed though, the a/c in my older models got colder quicker was much colder. I saw a comment to the opposite so I am not sure why this is. I have had an 02 and 04 and you could freeze to death in there with the a/c on max. I did notice after running on the highway for a while, the car would stall if I got off the exit, stopped and then tried to take off again. I am not sure why this model does that. Over all, good price for a fun and reliable vehicle.

The only issues have been: Engine check light on briefly at 87K, and self-cleared (must have been a loose gas filler cap), and the rear tail light bulbs blow every 15K or so ($4 bulb-big deal). Other than that: just oil and filter changes. Car has been very reliable and solid.

Have only seen the dealer for routine service. This car is my daily-driver, rain, shine or snow. It has never failed to get me home, even in the snow! I've added a strut tower brace and a more-efficient (louder) exhaust. The exhaust seems to have helped the gas-mileage (avg 21- 22mpg mixed city/freeway). It is a comfortable car to take a trip in and the 500 watt stereo is fine. No squeaks or rattles.

We traded a very unreliable and quirky Mazda rx8 for this car, and every time I turn the key the Mustang jumps to life and is eager to run. The car handles very well considering its size and gives the driver a confident feel of the road, always in control.

If $ are tight, I recommend an 06 or 07--great bargains out there.  I personally chose a used GT instead of a new V6.

The interior in our opinion isn't too shabby either! We really like the retro styling. It is quite similar to the Mustangs of the 60's and 70's. That is where the similarities end. The ride is unbelievable for a car this price. The interior is so quiet for a convertible And we haven't been able to detect any cowl shake.

I’ve had to fix the exhaust a couple occasions, due to potholes. It’s my daily driver all year in Wyoming. I’ve had it through some pretty rough snow too. I ride snow tires all year also, they’re just nicer tread quality in my opinion. And I drive a lot of gravel. I’ve been stuck once, but shoveled and threw chains on to get out no problem. And during some winter storms I chain up regularly to reach the highway. Everything in the car works. It burns very little oil. It’s fast enough and looks cool. Lots of after market mods available. I plan to get new shocks and struts next as they are looking rusty, but they still feel stiff. I average 20-23 miles on the highway. The value on these cars is way more then the few thousand dollars you can buy one for now.

But when the '99s came out I was intrigued.  I bought my black 2000 5-speed as a lightly-used and nicely-equipped example (leather, Mach 460 stereo, etc.) in mid-2001.  Words cannot express how much I loved that car.  I drove it for 12 years and nearly 180,000 virtually trouble-free miles before trading it in on my current 2013 GT 5.0.  The good:  great performance, chunky masculine style that turns heads, cheap to maintain, very reliable, just the right touch of attitude, the sound of a 2-valve V-8 roaring through an H-pipe, reasonable economy for the performance, a good level of practicality for what it is.  My kids fit in the back.  Limitless aftermarket modifications and go-fast parts supply.  My dealer is great.  You're the coolest dad at your kids' school.  Keeps everyone at church guessing.The bad:  not much.  There are cars with better quality interior trim, more refinement, and nicer fit and finish.  But anyone buying a Mustang knows it's no Lexus.The ugly:  the backwards-hat crowd in bespoilered front-drive compacts with fart cans always wants to show off in front of you.  Your neighbors may hate it, especially if you install Flowmasters and do a full-bore romp on the gas pedal at 6 a.m.  Or at least they'll think you're a hoon.  Self-righteous European car owners may think you're tacky (full disclosure...my wife has a newer BMW X3, we're just not full of ourselves over it).  Cop bait.  Bottom line:  If you want a fast car that is reasonably practical and has just the right dose of good-natured obnoxiousness built in, you've come to the right place.  For any pre-2005 Mustang I recommend welding in a good set of subframe connectors to stiffen up the body structure for the long haul, and then driving the heck out of it.

It was outdated even for 20 years ago.  The V6 is severely underpowered.  Good luck accelerating in 5th gear unless you've got a ton of momentum.  Almost anything over an entry level 4 banger is faster.  In snow, it is undriveable.  In the rain, it is just plain dangerous.  Hydroplanes, and cannot get traction.  The car feels unsafe.  At high speeds, it was bumpy, and felt loosely connected to the road.  The car rusted out completely on bottom. Could pick chunks of rust off the frame.  I sold it to an unsuspecting buyer, who probably will have to part it out or crush it. In the near future.  AC was terrible. Tires go flat

Two years later a third child, a rattling dash and $3 gas made me realize this isn't a car for a long term relationship. To get 300hp for so little money corners must be cut.

I fell in love with this design when I saw it unveiled in numerous magazines and auto shows. From an interior that leaves you feeling swaddled in comfort to the retro gauges that seem to smile when you take a seat and a beautiful body design, this car catches the very elements that an American muscle car should have; attitude and appeal. The car is affordable and the performance is great. Space could be better, but works for a muscle car. Gas mileage is good considering V8 power and curb weight. Overall, kudos to FMC. This car has punched its ticket in the automotive hall of fame. "

The Mustang is reminiscent of another era in my driving experience. It is safer and more reliable that the cars of the 60's, but reminds me of them. I have a 1965 Mustang and it is neat to have them side by side and 40 years apart.

Lots of torque over a broad range of RPM's. Great fun to drive. Responsive steering, tight turning ratio. Fast gearbox. Gut-satisfying rumble. Beautiful to look at, fine styling inside and out. A street machine built for the straightaways, rather than a sports car built for the curves (rolls a bit). Rear single-axle bounces on bumps. Surprisingly civilized ride. Comfortable driver's seat, so-so passenger's seat, cramped back seats. Good but not great stereo. Cut to a price point, with some lack of amenities and space, such as small trunk and glove compartment, limited storage spaces inside. Interior upgrade a must. Recommend side air bag.

A red convertible mustang (even ten years old now) still draws quite the attention. Mine is a cop magnet, whenever I even consider revving the engine I know they are waiting around the corner for the next youngster in a red car. By today's standards a 200+ horsepower pony car is by no means american muscle, but nothing beats hitting interstate speeds in under 6 seconds with the top down.Pros: the ride is amazing, I'm used to riding bikes and being able to feel the road. Last year I made a deal with a guy, he was putting radials on his new gt and sold me his brand-new 2013 gt rims and his Perreli-nero-zeros for 300 bucks. Thus I have a nicer car then 95% of the people in town. It's a source of freedom and pride haha. But when I park somewhere everybody knows its me. Black leather interior, black roof (the fancy vinyl-ish kind, not the cloth top), and of course, the exclusive red sally paint job.Cons: The air conditioning can barely keep up with the heat of two passengers on a hot sunny day (105 degrees), but that's to be expected with a black topped car. Also, the engine is limited in fourth gear. Ruins my fun. But then again there's no need to even be in fourth gear under 85 miles per hour.

On day two I knew I made the right decision.  This car rocks!  The car generates amazing torque and speed.  The exhaust and engine are perfectly matched; it makes a deep throaty growl when I get on the accelerator.  The handling is superb. The first time I dropped the transmission into second gear going around a corner and goosed it, I'm sure I looked like the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland; I had such a grin.   This car is without a doubt more powerful, responsive and refined than the 5.0 GT I bought new in 1990.  I am so happy with this car I want to sleep in it. Thank you Ford! "

All-city driving yields terrible gas mileage, but cruising on hwy at 70mph, I get 28mpg easy. Installed AirAid conical air filter which made huge difference in throttle response, power and exhaust note. In 2nd gear at 3000 rpm, watch out! Very fast. Full-size luggage can fit in trunk, something most convertibles can't boast. Stereo is amazingly powerful, even on hwy w/roof down. Brakes could be better. Bumpy roads reveal rattles and looseness mainly in windows & roof. But for combo of V8 power, stick-shift control, topless motoring, mega- style and storage space, there's no competition at all.

White with Parchment top and parchment leather, interior upgrade package, 5 speed auto, anti-lock brakes/traction control, exterior sport appearance package. Even non-Ford fans can`t help but take a second look and make positive comments. Neighborhood kids coming by to take a look. Power and shift ranges seems just about right for a v-6. After careful examination can't find any flaws with paint or fit of exterior parts. Still playing with the My Color dash light feature (can`t decide on color I like best).Top is getting easier to lock down after raising it as it stretches. Less than expected road noise with top up.

They are not for any adult riders I know! I drive my Stang for pleasure,  there are so many after market upgrades for this particular year, I upgraded my exhaust system from the pypes exhaust with the resonators,  to the flow master super 44s with mufflers to quiet him down just a tad! Now he sounds like a true muscle car from the 60s. I also replaced the air filter to a k&n never replace cartridge filter with both changes I gained an additional 12 hp on the dyno! If you keep doing simple changes on your pony like these the HP can really add up! The ride is incredibly fast the z rated tires help keep him planted to the asphalt!  My car has no problem with speeds of over 120 mph at any given moment!  But I have to obey the law just like everyone else. .... so the track is best for running at those speeds and it is so worth it. I put some super snake stripes on him recently to make him look fast while he is just sitting, the rear window view is not all that great, some people have complained about a vibration noise in the rear of their own stangs, it is the muffler hangers! The vibration from so much power tends to move the silicone around the hangars causing the issue but once you fix this problem with a few more pieces of silicone problem solved.  Please note it took myself up to 2 weeks of regular driving to get use to the power at the wheels of this car! I have seen many new comers to the stang world get behind the wheel of the newest version of a Mustang and loose control just because they wanted to show off a bit, but had no idea how much power this automobile actually has.

For the first 5 years I had perfect service from this car. At 5 years 1 month the traction control came on by itself [on a clear, dry, straight, stretch of road] and cut the fuel and made steering very hard. This is very dangerous, if someone is following you and you lose power it would be easy to get hit from behind. Ford dealership tried to sell me a steering box, even I knew this wasn't the problem. After much research I found this is a common problem that ford has not really addressed. I have taken it to other places that say it could be a sensor or any number of things. I really enjoy the car, and have decided to keep it for awhile longer to see if this happens again. With only 52,000 I don't think it should be giving problems. Overall it's been a good car.

Camaro performance not up to par here.  Interior feels solid & looks GREAT, but I have an issue with the design.  Can't imagine why power cords should hang down in front of the dash console, or why I have to rest my arm on my pop bottle, or why I have to spend time pinching power cords through a tiny hole in the console. Be cautious of the 19-31 mpg.  My mixed average is 20 mpg.  Not perfect, but so sexy and fun to drive.

I've also replaced both headlamps due to delamination. Power windows still going strong, and I've never even had to replace a bulb or fuse in this thing! It's not as fast or sexy as a Trans AM, but it's way cheaper to maintain, and light years more reliable.

If you are looking for an electric vehicle I highly recommend it. I drove the Nissan Leaf, VW Golf-e, and Fiat 500e and the Focus Electric was the winner. It has the same body style as the gas-powered Focus and looks very sharp. It comes standard with fancy alloy wheels and the front grill and headlights make it look very sharp. There are only 2 model packages, and the difference is just the seating. The cloth seats made from recycled material are not great. I opted for the leather. The interior is well designed and has ALL the modern amenities like touchscreen, backup cam, blue tooth, steering wheel controls, etc. The LED lights that glow at night are a nice touch. You can pick the color and intensity! The stereo is a Sony and is decent but not great. The fact that the car is so silent all the time makes the stereo easier to hear and sound better. Driving this car is a true pleasure! The acceleration at any speed (with just one gear) is amazing. It's hard to restrain from going fast in this thing. It handles well and is very responsive. One big drawback is the turning radius. I often have to do a three-point turn when on a street whereas other cars could just make a tight u-turn. This may be my only complaint, other than the low mileage range. My 2016 model was rated around 85-90 miles per charge. In ideal conditions this does occur, however the heater and A/C will put a dent in the mileage. The heater more so than AC. In the winter I was getting more like 50 miles on a charge. But, I found that like a cell phone if you just plug it in regularly you never dip down too much. It comes with a charger that plugs into a regular 120v outlet. I run a 50 ft extension cable to where I park it. You can even put a little lock on the charger if parked outside. I love driving past gas stations and never having to stop. There are no oil changes! If you wish you had a Tesla this is the best next thing. With incentives from Ford and the state, I had $14,000 taken off the sticker price. That made the price $17,100 and my lease was based on that. Ford knocked it out of the park on this one!

The 3cyl turbo is weak at low RPM's, but comes alive from 3000-6500 and can be quite fun.  Pedal placement is atrocious for heal-toe shifting, but the after-market has a fix to realign the throttle pedal.  Overall, the engine is raspy and fun at high rev's while economical at normal speeds.  EcoBoost folks: You get Eco OR Boost... pick with your right foot!

I received a class action lawsuit in the mail against their transmissions, after I went through all that hassle. I'm now just at 100k miles and my rack and pinion goes in the car. The part is recalled on the fusions and the fiestas but not the focus. The part is about 1200 and takes four hours of labor. Another pricey fix.

I also took under consideration this is a dual-clutch transmission.  It isn't a typical automatic transmission. In February 2018, the transmission did give me some trouble. They replaced a module and the clutch. No money out of pocket since the transmission is under warranty for 100k. I have driven the car cross-country and found it to be quite accommodating.  The infotainment is wonderful.  The drive is firm, yet smooth.  Gas mileage ranged from 28MPG (mountain driving) to 38MPG (TEXAS...).

For the Focuses and the Fusions the clutch WILL degrade and will need to be replaced over and over again. Your car will shake and shudder in stop and go traffic. It will lose power when going up hills, stalling out. With less than 30,000 miles on the car I had the clutch replaced 3 times, took the car in for 2 recalls, and 2 system reboots. Every Ford mechanic told me the same answer; there is no permanent solution for this car, just bring it back in when it starts to shudder again. I was smart enough to buy the premium warranty, providing me with a rental car each time I took it in, because this car was ALWAYS in the shop. Even though Ford knew they sold me a lemon, their mechanics know it, their sales reps know it, they even train people specifically to deal with disappointed Focus and Fusion owners, they would not honor the lemon law and agree to a buy back process. After hiring an attorney to represent me and a year of jumping through hoops I have finally got my money back and got out of this car. I will never be buying a Ford again after this terrible car."

I later found out when the dealer had to replace the part that went bad, that this was a common problem with this particular vehicle.  As much as I love this car, had I been told this, I would never have purchased it.  Since this is the same transmission and the part replaced is just like the one that went bad, does that mean 3400 miles from now I'm going to have it go bad again.  Why has Ford not done a recall on this model, and put a different transmission in this vehicle.  I have always been a Ford dire hard person when it came to my vehicles, but now I am beginning to wonder if I should look at other models.  Truthfully,  I would reconsider buying this model, it's not worth the money for the type of problems it is causing.Since my last review, I have had no other problems with my cars transmission.  Apparently, I must be one of the lucky ones when it came to transmission problems, because I have received several pieces of mail from different lawyers wanting me to file in a class action law suit, but in order to do this, the car would have needed to have had more than three returns to the dealership for transmission problems.I'm happy to say that I am still loving my little car, but like in my first review, had I known that Ford was aware of this problem and did no disclose it to the public, I would have chosen a different model.  I'm just glad my car has had only one transmission problem so far.  My warranty will only cover these problems, if it happens again, until the year 2019, March.

From the start the transmission was jumpy. Taking off from a stop that car shakes back and forth like it doesn't want to go. This type of acceleration is dangerous if you need to get out of the way. Dealership was no help and I was told there is not fix except computer updates which don't work. I have had 3 computer updates since having the car. I will never buy from Ford again. Value of the car went down quick. Now that I have had it long enough and paid of enough it will be traded in for a better car NOT with Ford. I will be surprised if someone doesn't get help with this issue. I was told sales reps do not have to tell you about the problem. No integrity!!

The Focus has an automatic manual transmission (it is a manual trans that shifts automatically) but this one has been in the shop 4 times to have the trans gone repaired. They have done a recall but just cannot seem to fix it. My friend is on her 3rd repair at 20k mi and is going to lemon law the car. The trans slips under mild acceleration causing it to shudder in the 1st couple gears.  The electronics package for cell phones is terrible. We would struggle to get it to pair with our cell phones and it would work for about 2 months then stop again. We just gave up. Also the interior is made out of cheap materials. The sun has completely eaten away the vents in the rear window deck and it looks like the car is 20 years old. Bad thing is we live in Oregon and get like 3 months of sun a year.  Lastly there is no rear seat leg room. When I am in the car I have to jam my legs up against the dash so that my 11yo son has some leg room.  I would not recommend this car.

I have had no trouble with this car at all and it is a pleasure to drive! (Mind you I change the oil and rotate tires whenever the timer on the car tells me to) In 2016 it still looks new and runs like new. I highly recommend it to drivers who enjoy controlling the car with a stick shift, good power, a sleek look and the decent gas mileage that comes with a compact car.

Then it is jerky the rest of the time at low speeds like stop and go traffic. I've had it in to the dealer 4 times so far. They have replaced and reset the control modules but it has not helped. Ford has extended the transmission warranty but if they're not going to fix it what good is an extension.  If I had known the problems I never would have purchased it.

The third time is certainly not a charm :(    Both the dealership where it was purchased, and papa ""Ford"" do not stand behind the product they sell.  Turn away now and run...don't look back, just keep running.  This is not a safe car and once they have you hooked...it's your problem and not theirs.This is an update postSince writing the previous review.  I was almost seriously injured in this car, when changing lanes and accelerating.  The car jumped forward, then shuttered and almost stalled.  The truck from the opposite lane just narrowly missed hitting me.  I took the car to a different Ford dealership, since the last one was less than honest.  The transmission module and clutch were replaced (note this is now the second clutch replacement) and reprogrammed it.  Then about 2 weeks later, I receive a notice from Ford regarding the transmission and potential failure....just a wee bit late...and a 10 year extended, transferable warranty.   Although the new dealership had much better service, the problem continues to persist. The car has been reprogrammed about every 2-3 months.  I really don't want my problems extended for 10 years :(  Ford doesn't care about customer service or satisfaction.  (Oh, and now there is a recall for a door latch issues.).     Well after almost 18 months, I received an acceptable settlement offer from Ford in the 11th hour before the pre-trial hearing.  I am no longer driving a lemon, or a Ford vehicle.  The stress level has dropped by a factor of 10.   For anyone stuck with the transmission issues....it does not seem to get fixed... I would suggest ditching if you can.  Best of luck.Bought a Buick Encore - so very much better.  Never a Ford again!!!!!!"

I was lucky I was not far from home. I was driving down the road and the transmission started slipping. I got home and had no reverse gear at all. That car left me completely stranded. Who ever`s  idea of the Power Shift 6- speed transmission was, was not much of a contributor to strategic Air Power like General Curtis E. Lemay. As soon as the space weather confirms its okay launch, call in an SLBM strike from a Ballistic Missile Submarine on  a Ford Focus Power Shift 6 speed transmission facility from SSBN734. I would never want to drink the same water as [non-permissible content removed] over at the Ford Motor Company drinks. When I got my 2014 Ford Focus back, I noticed a splash guard missing from under the front of the car. I did not even have the car for two and a half years and the poor mechanical condition of the vehicle forced me to trade it in on July 5, 2017on a Mazda3. Those Ford dealers don`t want anything to do with their customers at the first sign of trouble. Ford motor company must be an extremely adulterated UFOologist.

Ford was offering some massive model year end rebates and I couldn't have asked for a better price. I have put 45,000mi on the car since I purchased it and have had absolutely zero problems or complaints. (Still on original tires, brakes, etc.) Overall the focus offers decent fit and finish for its segment; my cloth seats are comfortable and supported, the gauge cluster is well laid out, etc. I'm 6'1"" and can enter/exit or cruise long distances very comfortably. As with any car I've owned, I wish it had an extra 100hp,; but the 2.0l is plenty quick for what it is. The clutch engagement and pedal feedback are above average, the gearshift has a little slop but engages with confidence at every gate and provides a relatively short throw. Braking effort is mild, the focus stops quickly in an emergency but in everyday usage the rear drum brakes cause for a little more frontal braking dip than I'd prefer. Handling is excellent for the price: very responsive steering with little wheel effort and a firm but grippy stance. Suspension is on the firm side; though aside from lightly feeling every bump, it by no mean invokes discomfort. Honestly, I beat the living crap out of this car. 6500rpm in 2nd gear while merging onto the freeway every day, double gear downshifts for passing, E-brake slides every time it snows, etc. I work in a steel mill with no paved roads, and this car handles potholes and ruts I'd never expect of something with such a low stance. I've nailed potholes that would swallow a motorcycle and kept on cruising without a hitch. I can truthfully say that I am astonished at the reliability and resilliance of the Focus, especially considering the torture I expose mine to regularly. I can't really speak for clutch life; but at 45,000mi, mine behaves like it did when it was new even after teaching my fiancée how to drive stick. So here comes the bad stuff/things that irritate me, and really it's all very petty. The cup holder placement makes shifting a little awkward when you've got a thermos stuffed into either one. One instance in January with an external temperature of -15°f, the center screen that displays radio station information failed to power on until I restarted the car. Never had the issue again after that, but it's worth noting that I have never experienced any issues starting the engine in cold weather. The radio/speakers are a typical stock system, so don't get your hopes up if you buy the SE version like I did. Sound quality is pretty good, but aside from that It's exactly what you'd expect from a commuter car. The glove box interior space is a little weird... Very deep but not very tall. If you keep a gun in there, you're going to have a hard time reaching into the abyss to find it with your seatbelt still on (I'd suggest a shoulder holster, because the center console isn't much better.) Save the glovebox for storing baseball bats, crossbows, or fishing poles. The brake/gas pedal spacing and pad size make heel/toe shifting nearly impossible, but that's probably just a carryover from the car's automatic transmission configuration. It's not a race car, so I guess I can't complain too loudly. Traction control has to be manually deactivated through the menu displayed between the speedometer and tachometer every single time you start the car. It's be okay if it was just a TC on/off button on the dash, but this set-up requires navigating several menu screens and a 5sec wait time. If you drive in the snow often and intend to paddle through rough spots with high speed wheel rotation, it's a pain to go through all that trouble every time you plan to drive. Annoying, but livable. My car came equipped with a sunroof I neither ordered or asked for, but it wasn't listed as a charge on the option sheet so I guess I just got an 'extra'. I don't use it much; but once when I clicked the switch to shut it, the pane of glass bounced back open after closing like It had encountered an unexpected blockage. Second time it closed and stayed that way, I've not experienced the issue since. Lastly, there's this weird little pocket sewn into the left front corner of the front passenger seat that doesn't exist on the driver's seat. It's a pocket, what's the big deal? Well it's a worthless pocket with no justifiable purpose or shape. The best use I've found for it is stashing a spare lighter or small amounts of stuff best kept concealed from plain view... Money, drugs, whatever you're into; that pocket is your business. It still irritates me for it's obscurity, but you can be the judge.Side note: The headlights are far reaching and well focused, the brights are exceptionally brilliant so if you have a grudge against oncoming traffic - This car is for you. The steering wheel and gauge cluster are exceptionally designed as well. Buy a (manual) Focus, beat the crap out of it and love it forever. Zero regrets."

I drive a little more highway miles than stop and go, so it my averages are skewed on the high end, but it has to get ~33/39 (I average about 37) in the warmer months and ~29/35 (I average about 33) in the winter months. The original price of the car is good and my car payments are definitely manageable. I haven't have to have any repairs. My bluetooth connectivity acted up once, but all it required was pulling the fuse, starting the car, turning off the car, and putting the fuse back in.Overall, I do wish to change a few things: during winter, the wipers sit really low, below the reach of the defrost, so if it's really icy and they freeze, it's impossible to dethaw them. Also, the contours of the car mean you have to wipe away snow above the door or else it will fall onto the seats as you open them.Apart from winter worries, if you have a passenger, the bar between the passenger, the seat, etc. block the blind spot more than I am used to. Also if there is a tall cup in the frontmost cup holder it interferes slightly with the gearshift. Overall these are minor flaws, and overall I am very happy with it.

The first was a 2011 which I loved.  Great mileage, handled well and reasonably priced.  I traded in the 2011 for a 2014.  Initially I felt once again I'd purchased a reliable mid-size sedan which handled well, had great mileage, was comfortable, roomy and in my opinion a classy looking car.  Approximately 17,000 miles in I started having acceleration issues.  The car would jerk and was slow to get up to speed when accelerating.  I had a scary situation when I was going up a ramp in a parking garage and it felt like the car was going to lose power and roll backwards.  The sputtering and jerking usually starts after driving the car for a while.  I've had the car inspected by a Ford Dealer and was told I needed the clutch assembly replaced.  That was over a month ago.  I contacted the dealer today and was told that clutch assembly parts have been ordered for many customers and none of the parts have been delivered by Ford.  With all the complaints I don't understand why it's taking so long for the parts to be delivered.  I have no choice but to drive my car everyday but I have to say the complaints I've read make me very leery.  I'm also disappointed in the customer service and customer outreach due to I was never contacted by Ford or received any notification regarding the transmission issues.  It was only after I heard about a report on my local news and I started doing some investigation on my own.  When I purchased my 2nd Ford I could see myself being a Ford customer for many years to come; now I'm not so sure."

When I finally called in August 2015 after I told them what the car was doing it took me two months to get in to have them diagnose the problem because as I was told this was a problem with this model.  Once I got it looked at in October 2015 I was told it was the clutch as they had suspected.  They returned the car to me and I was told 4 to 6 weeks to get the part in.     In middle to late December 2015 I called to see if the part was in and NO.  I was number 30 on the list (so there are 30 cars before mine that are waiting on this part)       Called in late January 2016 to see about the part and NO part for my car yet I am number 23 on the list.  In the meantime I continue to drive this car which shudders and sputters every time I drive it wondering if this is going to be the time that it will shudder and sputter until it dies and I am left stranded.     Call a 1-800-392-3673 number I was told to contact to see why I cant't get this part for my car.     This is a KNOWN problem with this car.  Google it and you will be amazed at the problems they have with this car.     I can't believe Ford isn't manufacturing this part faster than this so this can be repaired and that they continue to sell this car (It's just not with this model year.  If you go online it with this model in general).      This is the first Ford I have ever purchased and you can count on it that it will be the last.           Customer service by Ford in manufacturing the part and getting out to the dealership (at least the dealership I am dealing with keeps telling me they are getting about 3 parts per week from Ford) so these repairs can be made is terrible.

The vehicle's transmission has flaws that cannot be fixed by Ford.  I have taken my vehicle into the dealership for transmission problems a total of 4 times.  Every time it has been at the dealership ive been without a car for a week or more at a time.  The vehicle makes grinding noises, shutters, slips gears, and transmission overheats.  Everything else could be ignored except for the transmission overheating.  It's gotten so bad, that when stuck in traffic the vehicle instructs you, through the small screen in between the gauges to pull over.  When the transmission starts to overheat, you can really feel the vehicle shake and pull hard.  Its gotten so bad to the point that I was almost stranded on the freeway at almost midnight, in some of the worse traffic I have ever been in.

I have a 2014 Focus, and had to have my transmission repaired after owning the car for just a few months. The car lurches forward on its own, stalls when you're trying to accelerate, and is generally dangerous to drive. Ford switched to ""automatic dual clutch"" transmissions in these cars, saying they help with fuel economy. They are dangerous. I've been calling my dealership for four months since the problems came back, and every time I call they say that Ford won't send them the parts to repair these transmissions. Ford is choosing not to fix this. Buyer beware.Update: Happy to have sold this car and moved on."

They reset the computer in the car and sent me on my way each time, stating a new clutch would be needed eventually. The car jerks in stop and go traffic and it's awful! The other day while driving 40-45mph the RPMs shot up to 7000 for no reason, the car didn't actually go faster but you could feel something wasn't right while the car was shifting. It always makes awful grinding noises that you can clearly hear even when you're listening to music.On a positive note the steering and brakes work great, no issues there. Tight handling and stops instantly. The interior is clean and the monitors are nice. I do have issues with my SYNC that's built into the car sometimes. I love the design of the exterior.

Fortunate for however is that I had manufacturers warranty, but that doesn't make me happy knowing that this isn't going to be the first in going to have transmission failure...

The A/C quit working at 60,000 miles, right past the warranty period, and now having numerous electronic issues from the radio to the windows at 70,000 miles. Original review: First, I purchased the 2013 Ford Fiesta (Brand new). Went in for transmission repairs FIVE times. (Lurching, jerking, hesitation, failure to switch gears, and finally stalling out). The dealership kept telling me it was fixed each time. They gave me the run around until I was worried my warranty would run out before they actually got the problem fixed.  So thinking I got a lemon, I traded it in for a new 2014 Ford Focus. This one is even worse. Same exact transmission problems. Shutters terribly when trying to switch gears, will stall out trying to upshift, and then suddenly LURCH forward with the RPM's going to 6,000 almost 7,000. Power will stall out when merging onto the highway. Has nearly caused numerous accidents. Not only are these cars poor quality, they are very dangerous and hazardous to drive. When the light turns green, and your car stops mid-intersection with oncoming traffic, and then suddenly lurches forward at top speed, thats a problem. I am currently waiting on my second repair for my Focus, and have been told by the dealership that the clutches for the transmissions are on 8-12 week backorder. Not sure if this transmission will even last that long. The car has 31,000 miles, issues started at 15,000. Have spoken with the class action attorney in California, and a lemon law attorney here in N.C.  My advice if you get/have one of these cars, KEEP and collect ALL your repair records.  The lemon law attorney here told me that Ford has been VERY slow, much more slow than other manufacturers to even respond to their lemon law complaints, because of the sheer number of them coming in.  So in my opinion, stay away from Ford all together. I know I will from now on.

Bought it brand new from the dealer, after 50,000 miles the transmission needed $1,000 worth of work. Now it seems like every 50,000 miles the transmission needs $1,000 worth of work due to a design flaw. The interior is super cheap plastic, I have lost or broken quite a few plastic clips and screw covers. The engine was it's only saving grace until this past weekend. It used to be peppy and good on power, but this weekend it started surging and sputtering. The OBD codes were for misfires, so I replaced the spark plugs and ignition coils, $350 repair didn't fix it! Tried to check fuel pressure, there is no schrader valve connection on the fuel rail to check pressure. Had to take it to the dealer, we will see how much this will cost me. Engine light keeps coming on for the catalytic converter, I replaced the O2 sensors, but the light still comes on. The entertainment system is quirky, sometimes it will not connect to blue tooth or the USB with my Ipod hooked up. I have had to shut off and turn on the radio multiple times to get it to connect. I got a new cell phone, it was a pain to get it hooked to the blue tooth for hands free operation. When using the blue tooth for a phone call it is so quiet I can barely hear it at highway speeds, I have to turn it up to full volume. It handles well, you can really throw it through some turns, but that's no saving grace. Bad weather sucks! it hydroplanes in the rain, it floats on top of the snow when it snows. The climate control is good. The interior is super small and cramped, I barely fit with the seat all the way back. It take alot of effort for me to crawl out of it, I'm 6'1"". There is no use for the back seat, no one is ever fitting back there!! The best use is to keep it folded down for cargo capacity. Fuel mileage is rated at like 38 highway, I get like 32-34. Resale value SUCKS! I still owe $8,000 on it, trade in value is only $3,000!!!!!! Less than half of what I owe! I can't even trade it in to get rid of it! Blue book for private resale is only $6,000. I was hopeful when I bought it, it was my first ford, and my first brand new car. Now I am severely disappointed."

Transmission clunks and produces strange audible noises while downshifting. In addition to this, it  also downshifts  unnecessarily under slight throttle while at speed. Ford claims transmission problems are normal (because it is a dual clutch), but these are the results of a badly designed sloshbox transmission, not a problem with DCT themselves. I have a friend with higher miles on his, and it even falls to neutral while shifting, and the clutch slips even worse and Overall, I wish I could have the same car with the manual transmission.

The auto is a bit sluggish off the line - but if you use the manual buttons, it's fine. Frankly for most of daily driving, the shift pattern probably contributes to the higher mpg and is more than capable of keeping up with traffic. Seats take a bit of adjustment but are worlds better than the 1st gen. I'm not particularly enamored of most compact styling - It is a smart-looking car, and the Focus still gets ""sexy"" appraisals - it's not Mazda Sexy, and I'm ok with that, because, frankly - Door dings, etc. aren't as traumatic. They just add to the character. It's sexier than the Volkswagen, less so than the 3. I don't love this car as much as, say, my Mustang - but it's a solid car, with loaded features, at a low price that you can drive daily, and not worry about in an airport parking lot.

This, without a doubt, will be our last. The 2014 Ford Focus dual clutch transmission is nothing short of abysmal. We have replaced the clutch 3 times already and the cars is not even 2 years old. This is not due to harsh driving, weather conditions or lack of regular maintenance. We take great care in maintaining all of our vehicles. The clutches last approximately 5000 miles before the horrible vibrating/shuddering starts again. When changing gears at low speed, the car violently jerks and is difficult to control. We have reached out to Ford Customer Care many times and the only solution they offer is to cover all clutch replacements up to 50,000 miles. How about recalling these defective transmissions and stop putting peoples lives at risk? I plan on selling this car long before the 50,000 mile warranty is up and buying a Toyota or Honda instead. Very disappointing Ford, very disappointing indeed.** Edit - updated 03/13/17We need to replace the clutch again a 4th time. I have 33,000 miles and the clutch is starting to rattle and vibrate again. Enough is enough! I am trading this car in this week for a more reliable vehicle.

It tends to be my wife's car, more than mine, as I prefer the utility of my pickup truck as my daily driver.  We noticed the transmission shuddering more frequently through the last year and after three visits to the dealer, they gave us a loaner for a week and replaced the transmission clutch mechanism which was the basis for the problem.  The transmission now shifts smoothly in any mode.  Only problem is that they gave us a loaded Fusion as the loaner and my wife fell in love with it.  We may consider the Fusion as our next vehicle, but our intent is to get another 50,000 to 60,000 miles out of the Focus before we trade.   For now, it perfectly suits our needs...First Review Summer 2016:  I was hesitant in purchasing this car based on reviews related to the tranny.  We had purchased several vehicles; however, from Jordan Ford with exceptional service through the years, so because it was certified, and because we liked the sporty looks, we took the plunge.  We noticed the slight surge with the transmission, and I asked the service manager about it.  He said; ""you traded in a hot rod five-speed Mustang for this and you wound up with a hi-tech transmission that permits the features of an automatic transmission with the optional benefit of a sport shift manual"".  The engineering permits either option.  ""You'll notice a slight shudder initially accelerating in the fully automatic mode"", he said.  In the sport shift mode, you'll control it much as you did your five-speed manual in the Mustang.""  My main driver is a pickup truck, but when the wife allows me to drive the Focus, I choose the sport shift mode which is lots of fun.  We just completed a 2,300 mile road trip and the Focus performed like a champ.  Wish my truck had that navigation system...  We averaged 38 mpg on the trip and were quite comfortable, considering the size of the vehicle.  Plenty of room for our stuff with the hatchback and the Ruby Red with oversized 18"" wheels/tires and Titanium trim got lots of looks and nice comments.  To those who don't understand the tranny, read the manual to get the gist of the sport transmission, and enjoy the ride!"

In addition, the car has a shuttering when you excel from a stop.  We took it back and after several months waiting on a part - the dealership fixed the problem (so they said).  It has only been a couple of months and the shuttering has started AGAIN!!!!  I'm going back with her again.  They are going to fix this car or give her one that doesn't do it.Dealership wouldn't make it right.  They said it was ""normal"" and was not anything that needed repair.

So we made the decision to get a manual, it is fun to drive, a great little car so far, and we avoided the transmission issues which plagued the automatic.

They are only as good as what they are given. This was my answer the service manager gave me. Contacted ford and was given a refernce number to have a customer service manager to call me. She did.. Told i would hear back after she spoke with dealership manager. Over a course of three weeks and leaving her three voicemails i never heard back. Fourth week i made contact. She actually answered the phone. I asked why???? Her reply....i need to advise you your lemon law in the state of ga. There is nothing we can do for you. I was blown away! Now i have contacted the bbb auto line. No help lemon law in ga is one of the strictest i was told. We will contact ford for you but u are really at a loss. I drive a ford truck as well and love it.

However, almost all are about the DCM Automatic transmission.   If you want a great, fun car, buy the manual transmission version.  I'm very glad that I did.

I have about 45k on the odometer and will be trading it in as soon as the extended warranty runs out. First problem problem at about 10k the abs and traction control lights came on. Took it to Ray Varner Ford and They had to order a speed sensor and wiring harness and was told to bring car back the next day. Took a second day off from work to take car in once again but after I made the hour drive to the stealership they told me that the part had not came in and to call back to check tomorrow. Kept calling back but the parts never came in so after I gave up on that dealer I took it to Lance Cunningham Ford. I had started to notice a faint roar and informed them of the roar also. They diagnosed it with the same problem for the ABS and had to order parts. They couldn't find the roar and basically told me I was hearing things. Took the car back a couple of days later and they repaired the ABS light issue. At about 25k the same problem with the appeared. Took it back told them the roaring noise was louder. Once again I needed to come back for parts for the ABS. They found that the roaring sound was from the tires in the rear was cupped due to an alignment issue and that was not covered under warranty. They wanted about $400 to repair the alignment and put on two new tires. I declined and took it elsewhere for half the price. Took it back and had the ABS issue taken care of once again. At around 35k the ABS came on once again but by the time I could get it to a stealership I had already turned over 36k and the warranty was out. I took it to a different dealer and they diagnosed it with a bad ABS module this time and it was going to be a $2500 repair.  They even told me that the ABS module should have been replaced the first time and it had caused the wiring harness and speed sensors to go out the first couple of times. They called corporate and Ford refused to pay for the repair. I had purchased a third party extended warranty when I bought the car and they paid for most of the repair and it only cost me around $100 and two more days of missed work. I totaled it all up and these repairs although under warranty ended up costing me  around $2200 in missed work. My last car was an Accord and it had one problem with the radio while under warranty and they brought out a loaner car and picked my car up.  I made it 340k without any repairs other than routine maintenance. I will trade this in for another Honda as soon as the extended warranty is over.

It was cool, fun,sporty, smooth and solid. I bought it (used) right away thinking I just got a very great deal and a great car. But right away I was finding the car to have really strange transmission feel. When I was test driving it the transmission felt like like a munual. I just assumed it reved high because it was a sport car. It felt sporty. But later on after I bought the car I started notice some jerking when starting from a stop. With all this going on I decided to do some research on the car and transition. I didn't realize it was a dual clutch transmission (automated manual) when I bought the car. This explained the manual feel of it. After that I when on a drive to test the transmission and I was terrible, rough starts, jerking up hill, weird reving. I read reviews on here and everyone says the same thing. Lemon transmission. Dual clutches tend to be not a smooth as tradition manuals but this one is just awful. I can't believe ford would put a transmission this terrible in a car this day and age. My advice to you...just spend the extra money and get a Mazda 3 of corolla. Luckily my dealer offers a 3 day return policy. I will be sadly returning this car at once.

I did my research on this vehicle before I bought it and I knew what I was getting myself into by purchasing the DCT transmission. Not going to lie this car absolutely sucks in traffic. It lurches and lunges along however Its the best car ever on the highway. My job sometimes has me commute a lot all over the city (and state) and the car is very smooth on the highway. Acceleration isn't an issue and it gains speed quickly (quickly enough to merge and pass cars safely that is). Ive put on close to 15 thousand miles on it so far and I still really like it. I have the SE hatchback (in the very nice Tuxedo Black) great for hauling all the stuff I need. The back seat is very small but I rarely have people sitting back there for long so space isn't an issue. It also does surprisingly well in the snow. Being from southern Ohio I had to drive it in a lot of it this past winter and not once did i get stuck. I get great MPG and average 32 mixed driving (mostly city). I have learned to live with this car and I hope the car will last as Im ok with the DCT quirks but Ive heard mixed reviews about DCT reliability in general.UPDATE: Had clutches replaced twice and then the car just died on the road in April 2017. I really wanted to like this car but upset I dumped it at a Ford dealer where I traded for an Escape. I really didnt want to trade but the reliability had gotten so bad I knew I couldn’t afford warranty repairs once the warranty was up.Update: The DCT transmission is having serious issues. Owning the car now 15 months and over 19 thousand miles the shifting nearly stalls the car few times a trip. Ford is replacing my clutches but I won't get them until July or August as the wait time is 12-16 weeks on back order. Still like this car but I wish I bought a 5speed manual.

I wouldn't mind if it was a bit faster but for most of my driving it does the job. The front-wheel drive is OK. I understand there are better diffs out there with less torque steer and less quirky traction control. At the same time, the quick steering response probably saved my life when someone in front of me did something stupid. Being Seattle, there's a lot of that. The 4 wheel disc brakes have been great. A lot of people are complaining about the auto transmission and I can sympathize. It's pretty bad in stop and go traffic. It behaves just like a manual transmission does if you slip the clutch too much. On the other hand, I can put it in Sport mode and use a slightly heavier than normal foot and it scoots right along. Fuel economy has been pretty good. On long treks I get about 37 mpg. On average, with my Sport mode driving included I get about 27 mpg. Overall? Sure it could be better but considering the class it's in, I'm satisfied.UPDATE: Since my original review I've sold the car. It was still running well, I just wanted a larger vehicle. Other than that, my original review stands. Overall, the car was good, BUT, I think I would have enjoyed the manual transmission rather than the automatic.

This is a great vehicle other than the transmission.  Transmission would at slow speeds hesitate, shudder, jerk back and forth, go in and out of gear, and had metal sounds ( like silverware clanging) coming from under car. When I would take off from a stop you never knew if you were going to go or shake and shudder for 2 to 4 seconds sometimes more and then go. Sometimes it felt it would stall but never did. When I bought this car it did none of this at first and it started to do this after 5 to 7 thousand miles and progressively got worse. Had it in shop at Ford to fix and it was much worse after reprogram. Talked to Ford about it again and was told that the shuddering could never be totally fixed and would always be there due to nature of transmission.  I told them I had looked on the internet and saw that this was a common problem and that it doesn't seemed to be able to be fixed by Ford and that I wasn't happy about this. At this point they tried to get me into another Ford vehicle but did not give me a good trade in value for my 1 year old vehicle (I wonder why???). It was the one chance the Ford dealer had at keeping me and they screwed up so I traded my vehicle in somewhere else.   All the money I've spent on service visits repairs and new tires (4 sets) over the years on other fords I guess didn't mean much.  I am now giving my business to a company that has very good reliability ratings for their vehicles so hopefully I don't run into this again.  If looking at this vehicle for your next car do your homework first.Traded focus in for honda civic and have had zero problems.

I bought the car new in the fall of 2014. The color of my car is ruby red. The car is a hatchback, with the black appearance package. This package allows the car to have a black Focus ST spoiler, glossy black grill and mirror, along with black inserts in the headlights. The car has black leather interior, with ambient lighting. This is my daily driver, wouldn’t change it. I drive it anywhere, whether it’s to and from school, or drive 45 minutes to go see my family. I do plan on changing a few things to add my own touch. Looking to add a body kit next summer, also change out the stock headlight bulbs to give it a better appearance at night. Want it to look more like a rally car if ever possible. I do wish the paint was better because I have a chip that is noticeable when you are up close. I do get a lot of complements on how people like my car and wish they could get one. I do like to park in the back of a parking lot because I don’t want to take any chances of someone hitting it with their door or backing into me. I recommend buying this car if you are looking for great mpg, or something small to get around in a city. You are able to get this car in many colors and styles depending if you want the base model or on the higher end. Pros•	Sport option for speed or auto for the fuel economy•	Smooth to start up•	Good acceleration •	Great for the snowy streets, even going up hill•	Inexpensive to fill the tank •	Plenty of storage, even greater with the rear seats down.•	A lot of head room and space, even for myself (6 feet tall)•	Great ambient lighting colors to choose from with a twist of the dial•	Back seats are comfortable•	Very easy to customize to add your own touch•	Being able to park anywhereCons•	Transmission does get stuck in low gear if you slow down quickly•	Not a lot of leg room in the back seats•	Have payments unless you pay cash•	Taller people have trouble with little room"

It reminds me of a manual transmission in an old VW. Mine has now 5200 miles on it and no real problems.. I don't know that i will keep it more than 1-2 years/or when warranty expires.  I would recommend if your thinking about buying one to maybe look for 1 that is a year old with low mileage  as its cheaper than buying new.  Car easily gets over 30-35 mpg on freeway.  Around town a bit less, but who does in City traffic or hills of SF.

I liked the car at first, but in the first few days of driving it, I noticed the quirkiness of the automatic transmission. When I was test driving the car the salesman told me not to punch it because the engine was not broke in yet. But now I know why. It was because the car will hesitate we attempting to quickly take off from a stop. And the hesitation is significant.  At the 3,000 mile mark, the fuel pump in the gas tank went out, leaving me stranded. I had to have it towed back to the dealer to have them install a new fuel pump (Under warranty). At the same time I had them replace one of the back passenger windows because of a scratch inside the glass itself (Also fixed under warranty). Now at the 10,000 miles, the car is starting to shudder when in slow traffic. There's also a clunk sound when accelerating from a slow speed. I'll never buy a Ford again, and Edmund's needs to re-think their review of this car.

The regular swish-style gearbox is simple in that one bears down on the throttle to go fast and eases to slow. DCT requires one to drive with a manual gearbox mentality. To quickly get to 4th or 5th, stay below 2500 rpm and then once on 4th or 5th one can push beyond 3000rpm to get some speed - I suspect that's when the turbo kicks in. I've found 6th works best in the range between 2200 and 2600rpm.

The SVT is the most fun to drive for under $20k. For that little itch inside that we all have, it has that punch when you just want to shoot around a slowpoke in traffic. The ride is right on, not too stiff yet enough to throw it around a corner when in a hurry. Stereo is awesome for a compact car. Tire class is right up there. If you're asking for more then you're asking to much. Interior room is comfortable for such a small car.  Even for backseat passengers it is capable of comfort. The sunroof and leather bolsters around cloth seats gives it a taste of luxury. Suspension is A+. There are affordable bolt-ons that make it even better. A+

I especially like the 6.5ft bed and reverse sensing system.  Looks great, drives great, but if you're not used to big trucks, it will be scary the first time you park.  Interior is little on the bland side, but that's not why I bought it (maybe better in the more expensive models).  Interior storage is the only disadvantage, there isn't any!  Gas mileage is typical for a V8.  The Flex-fuel engine is cool (although E85 is still too pricey/limited for regular use).   It would help to have the cylinder-disabling system that other V8s have.  Tows like a dream, you forget the trailer is even there.  A word of caution, this truck does not fit in a standard garage.

This should get better as the engine breaks in - I'm still under 1,000 miles on the odometer.  I opted for the King Ranch F150, 2WD, SuperCrew, equipped with a sunroof & the 20"" wheels.  It feels like a very solid truck on the road, yet fits into the garage.  It drives like a dream on the highway.  It is very nicely appointed on the inside & out, and the King Ranch Castano leather is second to none!

The King Ranch model could not be matched by any other truck. I had considered the Titan but found that the reliability on the Nissan was less than acceptable. The Dodge had the most horribly unstable ride (felt like I was on a boat) and the Chevy is just plain dull looking. Overall my F-150 has been a real pleasure to drive, you almost forget you're in a truck. But, when you need to pull a trailer or haul a load, the Ford performs like a champ. Not the fastest truck 0-60 (due mainly to its hefty weight) but it will pull just about anything. My biggest complaint is the ride can be bumpy at times due to a short wheelbase.

The 2006 model is like night and day.  I have had no problems whatsoever with this new truck.  Comfort, style, quietness and quality are all superb.  Fuel economy is so so at 16.0 mpg and the performance is OK, but nothing to get excited about.  But, what the heck, this is a large, and heavy vehicle, not a sports car.

The 20"" tires take some getting used to, because they ""hunt ""ruts in the road, but they do offer good traction on smooth roads.This edition was apparently the only way you could get a black interior in a 2000 F-150.It is stylish and very comfortable on long trips,with captains chairs in the front. However, the rear seats are not designed for comfort on long trips (as per my mother in law).....but Harley bikes don't offer as much comfort to the passenger as the driver,....soooo. I love the extended cab/stepside look,the only extended cab/stepside in this body style( after the 2000, they were 4 door, short smooth side bed ).This is also the only truck with a smooth roof( the others had structural ridges in them.This truck is very capable of pulling about any trailer you want,but if you want to haul something in the bed, you need to remove the stylish,hardshell tonneau cover. However, just like the motorcycle,this truck is designed to ""style and profile""instead of being a work horse. Overall, I love this truck,and am very happy with it. Mine has 154k on it,and so far I've had to replace 3 coils/wires,and the rear end slips a little when you pull out on a hill and turn left or right.These trucks are affordable right now, and they may rise in value as they get older,being the first year of a fairly long run of this edition."

I’m really glad the dealer ordered it with the 2.7 Ecoboost over the base engine; it’s well worth the $995 premium.  Excellent acceleration as well as highway power.  It’s amazing that this engine is exactly half the displacement of a V-8 5.4 liter Expedition I previously leased yet it produces 25 more horsepower and more torque.  I just completed a trip of almost 3000 miles with the boat in tow.  I had no problem cruising at 80 mph with ample power for passing.  The reduced weight of this aluminum truck is listed at only 4400 lbs on my registration. The seats in this basic model were remarkably comfortable for both myself and my passenger for a long day of driving.  I never had to alter my position to avoid discomfort, cramping, or pain.  The only seats I’ve ever experienced that are as comfortable for all day driving are in my S class Mercedes sedan.  What people say about the Ecoboost is correct; it’s a powerful, economical engine, just not both at the same time.  If you go lightly on the gas with nothing in tow, it gets better than 20mpg but if you use the more than ample power, it uses as much or/more gas than a V-8.  Rear seat comfort was adequate for adult passengers for short trips.  I love the Sync3 system that permits my phone’s navigation system to appear on screen but I hate Apple for restricting it to their map program and not Google. I hear that Waze is being added however.  Also, the phone keypad won’t work when truck is in motion, which sucks.  Try responding to an automated call when you can’t enter a single digit, even though it is much less distracting than doing many touchscreen functions that are permitted.  I’ve had one problem with the truck that Ford can’t seem to solve yet.  On cold mornings, the rear camera won’t work.  As soon as the vehicle warms up, it works and there is no problem if the temperature is above about 45 degrees.  My dealer has been unable to fix."

Daily driver stuff not a consideration. Got the XLT Supercrew with the 3.5 liter Ecoboost, 10 speed auto, 4WD, 302A, tow and off-road packages. The off-road package idea was to get a little more clearance and not scrape the driveway every time I hitched my boat. Being a 68 year old retired teacher the only way I'd normally go off road is if I fell asleep at the wheel on the interstate but you never know. Straight up saved me from being a Bigfoot meals on wheels while exploring a road/trail and accidently got into some deep, loose sand on the banks of the Trinity River. It was ugly. Popped that puppy into 4WD and drove right through it.

After driving for almost 10 months, with a 7,220 mile road trip and a thousand mile round trip tow experienced very, very pleased. If I had it to do over again be tempted to go with the 2.7 liter Ecoboost. Little cheaper, little bit more economical. For me the 3.5 is overkill - it'll almost jerk the trailer out from under the boat. Then again truck isn't tasked heavily so maybe it'll last longer. Truck got 22.1 mpg on the long road trip and 16.1 mpg on the long tows.                                                                                                                                                         Very comfortable. Rides well - maybe a tad harsh unloaded but does so very quietly. Even at 80-85 mph you can listen to music or actually talk to your passenger. Instrument panel adequate. Synch 3 is great. Very intuitive. Stereo system sounds great. Listen to everything from classic rock and roll to classical and space music. Great truck.

It wasn’t until my wife drove my truck that I was able to pinpoint it was actually the driver seat causing the pain.

By far, the Ford trucks are better in every aspect.  I have heard and read about people comparing other trucks to the Ford trucks; however, I can tell you from personal experience none of the truck makers compare to the Ford trucks.   The Ford trucks are engineered with such quality that it is noticeable  from the first drive.  Personally, the ride quality, comfort, and gas mileage have been superior.  The ride quality is better than most luxury brand cars.  The comfort is excellent especially for long trips for larger drivers.  The gas mileage is true as Ford states.  To get the best gas mileage make sure and use a top tier gasoline brand (i.e. Shell, Chevron, Mobil, Sunoco).    Previously, I owned another Ford  F150 during the late 90’s and that truck lasted for 220,000miles and had a high resale.  I am staying loyal to the Ford trucks.

Power and USB options everywhere you look.  Very comfortable ride.  Often there is a vibration but then again I live in Ga, roads here suck and yes..you're driving a truck.  Gas MPG is pretty decent for truck this size.  I am averaging 16-17 city.  I dont stomp on it much even though I installed a Roush intake and Flowmaster super 40 9"" muffler.  This thing is loud!  Has a very nice kick.  When you need the power, this 5.0 can move.  I am 5k miles in and still rides great.  I talk hype, so why the 4 stars than 5?  I have read other reviews about faulty alarm system.  I stopped to get gas and my kids stayed in the truck.  Out of habit, I lock the truck and fill up.  The alarm goes off and the kids did not open any doors.  I disarm, and lock the truck again, moment later, alarm goes off again.  A friend of mine has same truck, King Ranch.  He mentioned when you turn the truck off your panel gives you an option for all sensors or outside perimeter only.  Apparently the truck has sensors inside similar to a house alarm, if motion is detected, the alarm goes off.  A safety feature so you do not leave kids or animals in a hot truck, alarm would draw attention.  I never knew this.. anyone confirm this?  Transmission.. not so great.  I often feel a small jerk downshifting from 5-4, or sometimes shifting up 3 to 4.  If I approach a stop or yield on a decline road, the transmission will shoot to 1st gear so if i do not stop fully, you get a very nasty jerk when you accelerate.  I have driven a new Ford Fusion and Expedition and got similar behavior.  Come on Ford.. you guys have made so many improvements over the years, maybe ditch the wal mart brand transmission.  I have the 6dp by the way. I test drove a eco boost 10 speed and felt some jerk on and off.  I love my truck, I am very happy I went with Ford.  I have gotten allot of compliments how nice the truck rides and comfort.  We'll see how we're doing at 10k miles."

The ride was very comfortable and the front seats were very roomy although the backseat space was too tight.  Parking is difficult due to the size.  A week later I was given a Ford F150 for a week.  WOW what a difference!  The Ford was cheap feeling and looking inside.  It took a masters degree to figure out the instrumentation.  The back up camera was minuscule and useless.  The truck was easier to maneuver then the Silverado and the backseat room was huge.  Even with these pluses it the Silverado features and ride far out weight the Ford F150.

I have owned chevy's , Toyota,  dodge, and a Titan.  But over all this F-150 is by far the BEST handling , performance and the BEST mpg ( miles per gallon ) . We're averaging in town driving 18 miles to the gallon and interstate miles per gallon 23.8. I'm 6ft 4 and 374 lbs. And the truck rides comfortable and is easy to get in and out of. Ford has really stepped up to the plate as far as the overall expectations of a full size truck. The lighter body was an excellent idea, as we have now seen other dealers going to . We'really please to say that when 2020 the NEW FORD BRONCO is coming back to AMERICA. My wife said she will be the PROUD OWNER in driving that vehicle. One more thing-if your're ever in the PARIS, TENNESSEE area ,check out JOE MAHON FORD. They are the BEST folks that you will ever meet, their employees are the nicest and most thought of folks to deal with. If your looking for a caring, generous and giving sales person . Then you need to meet MRS. ANGIE sweetest woman to deal with and to know. Without her our visit may have not been possible. FORD NEEDS TO RECONIZED HER AS THE BEST SALESWOMAN OF THE YEAR. THANK YOU MOHAN FORD for making us a PROUD FORD OWNER.

That said, I took my new truck home and within a week noticed significant rust on several drivetrain components and on the rear differential. I went to the dealer and asked how a brand new car can have embedded rust already on it. They said not to worry, that it's normal on all their new trucks. They referenced the rust that you see on brake pads when a vehicle sits for a long period of time, this comparison is total crap. The next time you use your brakes the rust will disappear, while the rust everywhere else simply gets much worse over time. I did not realize until later the document they had me sign regarding future rust issues. I was told by a knowledgeable person that Ford decided to lower their use of environmentally unfriendly paint, which has dramatically reduced rust protection on the metal frame and other underbody components. Two months in and there are now new spots of rust, I should not have to deal with this on a new expensive truck. What a shame, I'll never buy a Ford again.

I have only owned this truck for two months, so I could not comment on a lot of the questions such as repair frequency, etc.  My initial impression of this truck is very positive except for one feature that is so idiotic that it is hard to believe.  The design of the driver's door handle and key lock makes the 2017 F-150 extremely easy to break into.  The lock cylinder is mounted on the door handle, not on the door.  When you pull the door handle out to open the door, you can look behind the door handle and see the lock cylinder.  To break into the truck, you just need to pull the door handle out, slip a pair of pliers behind the handle over the lock cylinder, and turn it.  Doing so enables you to unlock the truck, open the door, and get in within a couple of seconds without tripping any alarms.  I had a weapon stolen from my truck at a restaurant.  When the police arrived, they went right to the door lock and showed me how it looked like it was off center.  The police say they see this all the time with the new F-150s.  How could Ford engineers come up with something so stupid?  The fix is to replace the driver's handle and lock cylinder with one designed for the passenger door.  This fixes this bug, but leaves you exposed to difficulties getting into the truck if your truck battery ever runs down completely.  If this happens, you have to either break a window to open the hood or have the truck towed to the dealer.  Wow, what a monumental goof!!!!  See the Ford F-150 Forum for a discussion of this problem ( https://www.f150forum.com ).

Ford marketing does an outstanding job of offering complex color, engine, trans,  and options, schema(s) to maximize their profits (as they should). Also put the time into negotiating with multiple dealerships as they are all willing to ultimately make a fair deal when pressed by an informed buyer. This is the best truck Ford has ever made.

It is a step up from the 2013.  It has everything the Platinum had an much more.  I do a lot of freeway driving.  The 3.5L V6 and the 10 speed make the entry to the 75 MPH line of traffic easy and safe. Shazam, it is quick.  I added a spray-in , a Tonneau top, and power running boards.  It is like driving a royal limo.  In the initial 1500 miles, the average is 20.8 mpg, up 5 mpg from the 2013 Platinum. I would have a hard time listing all the superlatives that cross my mind about this truck. Quick, quiet, comfortable, well appointed, love the auto high beams, improved rear camera, voice activated navigation, and on and on. After 25,000 miles, my attitude and appreciaion for this F150 has not changed.  If anything, it has been enhanced with tie and usage.  Since I do a lot of freeway driving, I really like the quick aceleration from the entrance ramp to the line of traffic,  The yellow warning light in the side mirror has been very helpful in my avoiding accidents with vehicles in my blind spot.  Safety enhancments are overdue and worthwhile.Update: After 12,000 very enjoyable miles, a six point buck decided to jump out of the bush on the side of the road and smack me on the point of the right front fender.  It was so quick there was no time to respond. The deer went flying into the ditch and left me with $5000+ damage.  Compliments to Henson Ford Body Shop. Can't tell it ever happened.  It looks great and handles as smoothly as before.  After the rental car, this Ford is a dream.  Perhaps the old adage is true, ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"".When choosing the model on this template, I was not given the option of choosing the 3.5L V6 Ecoboost, but this truck has that engine."

With the addition of dual exhausts, better breathing into turbos, this truck would be scary fast. A friend has a brand new Ram 2500 with 6.2 motor and it has less torque than this ""little"" V6. Torque and HP is better than Ram or GM trucks. The interior amenities and techy goodies in this truck are really cool but also functional and targets safety, as well. People that have ridden in the back seats say it's cavernous. There a few items I think would make this a perfect truck. 1) more front seat comfort. While the massaging option on my Limited is nice, front seats seem to be a little rigid. Great leg room, but would like a little more length in seat area. Navigation commands still need improving. You should be able to ask navi questions and get answers similar to Siri on iPhone. Trying to get to a location without stopping and typing in locations, restaurants or other amenities is cumbersome. Start/stop option on this pickup is one of the best features offered and should be standard on every vehicle, diesels included. This will save billions of gallons of fuel yearly. But all things considered, I'm looking forward to keeping this beauty for at least 4 years. Also looking forward to what Ford's got in store for down the road."

It has the new 3.5L Ecoboost engine and 10 speed automatic transmission (the tool only lets me enter the review under 6 speed) with 3.55 gears. After 7 years of trouble-free ownership, I traded in my 2009 F-150 4x4 with the 6-speed trans, 4.6L 3V (V8) engine, and 3.55 gears for this truck. The powertrain is what makes the 2017 truly shine. Power feels endless and the truck is deceptively fast. The 10 speed shifts far smoother than my old 6 speed. It always seems to be in the perfect gear, and shifts are quick. I have not experienced any gear hunting or hesitation while shifting. Towing my 4,500 lb. boat is no problem at all. The truck doesn't seem to strain at all even while accelerating up long hills at 70+ mph. Acceleration feels effortless, and the engine is so quiet it is easy to find myself speeding. The Sync 3 system is a huge upgrade over MyFord Touch, and it is really intuitive. Overall the truck is beautiful and fuel economy has improved as the engine has broken in. I average over 19mpg in mostly city driving and plenty of idling during the cold winter starts (I always disable the auto stop/start feature). I have gotten 23 mpg during highway trips. The cab is huge, backseat is comfortable for adults, and plenty of storage. I do have two critiques. The front seats are a little firmer and less comfortable than the seats in my old 2009. They are power with lumbar and are certainly comfortable, but the seats in the 2009 seemed to hit all the right spots and fit like a glove. The other critique is the ride can be a little jittery on rough roads when unloaded.  It is still an acceptable ride quality, but I wish Ford would offer a soft ride option for those who don't need to tow 12,000 pounds (I will never tow more than 7,000). It actually rides much better with a few hundred pounds in the bed. I am confident this truck will hold up just as well as my last F-150 with years of trouble free performance. Great job Ford!

I plan to keep this one for a while. My family and friends are in shocked that I would upgrade but are proud of me for getting a great newer truck.

It was a little spontaneous, but my finances were in order and dealerships were running Black Friday ads featuring very aggressive deals. I assume this was because the all new 2015 aluminum bodies were on their way. Ended up purchasing a $38k for a little over $27k, a deal I could not pass up. Despite what the title says, it is actually a super cab 4x4.I opted for the 3.7L V6 (the non-ecoboost engine.) It's the base engine, but if you just drove it without knowing which engine it had, you would figure it had a V8. In other words, it doesn't feel underpowered. The engine is rated at 302 horsepower which looks impressive on paper. However, the engine creates 278ft/lb of torque. That means that in order for it to generate that much power, the engine must rev very high. (The 302hp rating comes at 6,500 RPM) You really have to press the gas pedal to wake it up. Once you do, it screams with plenty of power. To put this in perspective, a F150 in the 90's with a 5.0 made 275ft/lb of torque. That's just how far technology has advanced that a much smaller engine can do the same work consuming less fuel. My truck in its configuration is rated to tow up to 6,100lbs. If you need more capability than this, or tow frequently, the current 5.0 or 3.5 ecoboost are better choices. They generate 380 and 420 ft/lb of torque, respectively.The tradeoff I made for less capability was more fuel economy. No, I don't expect to buy a truck for great fuel economy. I bought this truck for the 4x4 in the winter and the bed for weekend projects. No need to consume more fuel for more capability that I would never need. The 3.7 offered the best fuel economy of the group, with 16 city, 18 mixed, and 21 highway. This was a real area of disappointment, here. I measure my fuel economy with both trip meters: Trip A is per gas tank, Trip B is per oil change. I did achieve 20.5mpg on a trip from Omaha to KC, but I struggled to ever get 16mpg on any given regular tank. 5,500 miles into my 10,000 mile oil change interval and I'm averaging 15.6mpg. This doesn't even reach the EPA estimated 16mpg for city driving! Yes, I regularly commute in ""city"" driving, but those miles included at a minimum 30% highway driving. Again, credit to advances in technology, this fuel economy is much improved compared to the old F150 in the 90's with a 5.0 generating the same capability. But compared to other newer engines, like the ecoboost 3.5, the difference in fuel economy is marginal and hardly worth the sacrifice in power and capability.We got hit by a couple of snow storms this past winter and the 4x4 made that a non-issue. Acceleration is great for a base V6 (I can usually keep the RPM's at or below 2,000 RPM for acceleration which should help with engine longevity) Transmission shifts great, doesn't jerk or do anything else annoying as sometimes happens with other cars. Again, this should help with reliability and longevity. Steering and braking are where they need to be. Really enjoy the SYNC system! Always have my iPod hooked up. Only frustration is that sometimes the voice command misunderstands what track I want played, but it's 90% effective. I rarely talk on the phone, but when I do its really convenient having the system automatically stop the music and let me talk hands-free. The sound system could use some improvement. It is weak, but I plan on making some aftermarket adjustments to fix this.This was a great and reliable truck. Never had any mechanical issues with it. However, I was intrigued by Ford's new 2.7 ecoboost engine that they released with the 2015 redesign. Not only does it offer more capability with 325hp and 375 ft/lb of torque, but does so with better fuel economy than my 3.7 v6. (Rated 18 city, 20 mixed, and 23 highway mpg.) So I recently traded in this truck for a new 2016 with the 2.7 as I think this is a much better engine choice for consumers like me. I will review this truck after 10,000 miles like I did for my 2014, but so far the fuel economy is living up to the hype this time. I think the 3.7 is better served as a fleet engine for cheap trucks that are cheap to maintain (i.e. no turbos.)"

Fixed and ran fine until 2 days ago when driving began hearing a grinding hum coming from the front.   Was worried driving would cause more damage or the truck would stop running.   Had to have a truck with 13K towed.   They believe it is a bearing in the front drive train.   All I know 2 days without a vehicle, not happy.

Average highway mpg is 19-20 and local driving is 16-18 depending on the season. I do wish it had a backup sensor or camera. It is difficult to judge where the rear bumper is when backing since it can't be seen in the mirrors. My only other issue is that there has been, and still is, an annoying little vibration in the front wheels. I've had the tires rotated every 5K miles, the balance and inflation checked regularly, and the alignment checked. I'm told (not by my Ford dealer) that the  issue may be coming from having the 20 inch tires instead of the 18's. Overall we would give the truck a 9 out of 10.

The truck has needed oil changes and tire rotations and nothing else. The only issue is aesthetics. Ford used too much plastic in the cab. The XLT should have incorporated some fabric or other material on the door and dash areas to break up all of that plastic. It gives a $35,000 vehicle a rather cheap look inside. The power from the 3.7 V6 is more than enough for those unless you are towing over 6,000 pounds on a regular basis. It has the acceleration of a V8 and great fuel economy. If you keep the truck at 70 MPH, you will get 21.5 MPG or better on the highway. I've made a few round trips from Florida to Ohio and my best was 21.9 MPG and there are a lot of hills and mountains on I-77. Overall I get 18.3 MPG on daily around Tampa, Florida driving. The AC is almost always on down here, so in cooler climates, there might be a better number. I'm in my late fifties, so I don't drive like a teenager, but I don't drive like a blue hair either. The warranty should be longer to better compete with other brands and the price of theses trucks is approaching insanity. But this is my fourth truck and even though those new Chevy's catch my eyes from time to time, you can't go wrong with the F-150. Acquired 3/2014

I enjoyed the 2014 but the lease was running out.I have had this Truck since 2/1/15.  It is great in the snow. With the 4 wheel drive you can get through just about anything. With the 5.0 liter I range around 14.5 in the city and it will get 21 MPG on the highway at 70 MPH.  It's comfortable and the back seat is huge especially with the seats up. The truck does many things right. It pulls my boat and trailer with ease which is probably around 4000 lbs. Even with the 5.5 ft bed, there is a ton of room since the sides are high. Here is a couple of annoyances.. In the STX model many times the rubber cup holder liner comes out attached to my coffee cup. I have never figured out how to retrieve a text when the blue tooth is on and I am a pretty techy guy. The manual does not explain the sync very well.  Around 20,000 miles I started to get some vibration when braking. I assume it needs the rotors turned. I have driven a few new GM trucks my friends have and I still like mine better than theirs. I don't know anything about the dodges as Chrysler as whole seems to have more reliability problems than Ford or GM.

During the summer of 2016, Ford replaced the points on clynder # 7. Then replaced the short block then sent out and had the heads rebuilt.  In the spring of 2017 a shutter in the transmission developed.   Ford reset the learning process but the shutter never went away. In the fall ford indicated that they thought the torque converter was bad,but they could not get one.  As such they replaced the entire transmission. Now after three resets of the learning process the transmission continues to clunk going in and out of first gear. Ford at this point doesn’t know what to do?  My truck has been in the shop for over 40 days to date with no resolution in site.  Thank god I bought the extended warranty!

I am 6 ft tall and cannot reach the pedals with the seat back as far as it can go! I love this truck except for the lack of interior storage (incredibly small glove box) and because of lousy gas mileage. My Tacoma had better interior storage. The hands free is very easy to use; there is no need for a premium stereo.  I go off road through major bumps and ruts on BLM roads to go dirt-biking. I pulled  7,000 pound auto hauler with an Outback on it and got 16.5 MPG over 1400 miles and barely noticed a trailer being pulled.  My model has a 3.5 L turbo, which I could not find on the review selections with a 6.5 ft bed.  Also, there is inadequate interior storage. Glovebox will barely close with just the service manual.Fuel economy on the 3.5 L turbo is really bad unless the truck is on the interstate.  Although most of my driving is off road, I average only 12 MPG with 10% small town driving, 50 % country roads and 40% 55 to 65 mph roads. The accelerator is extremely touchy; Rear tires regularly screech even with the traction control; replaced terrible tires it came with and put on oversized Michelin tires."

Been a real pain and I feel they are pulling one over on you personally.  Due to job change, I don't drive mine much, but still keep it around.  Ended up having to get $1,000 with or tires at 20K miles due to an alignment problem.  I asked Ford about it and they just told me ""sorry, maintenance is expensive"". My issue isn't the maintenance. My issue is that the ""Ford tough"" motto is absolutely crap when the mechanic tells me he recommends getting an alignment check every 6 months because even hitting a pothole can throw your alignment off. Really? I've never in 30 years had that issue. So it's ""built Ford tough"" until you hit a pothole in a Ford truck. There isn't anything ""tough"" about that, sorry."

Granted, I've only put 62k on it, and I typically trade every three years, so personally can't vouch for long-term reliability; however, as stated, I've had two trucks w/ eco and absolutely no problems. Not even an ECM update on either truck. I still have original tires on this one at 62k and have replaced front rotors and pads. The truck is max tow and it has pulled and hauled fairly (actually really) heavy loads without complaint. In fact, the truck is a beast when towing!

On a whim I stopped by a Ford dealership and drove a new F150 Supercrew cab.  Impressive!  I then went to a Toyota dealer and drove a new Tundra.  I wanted the 6.5 foot bed which the Toyota dealer said they could order for me, but the salesman lacked any enthusiasm for going thru that process.  The Tundra is a very nice truck, but I liked the interior layout of the F150 better, plus the gas mileage on the Toyota was not as good as the Ford.  Yes, gas mileage is important even though gas prices have been comparatively low for well over a year.  That will likely change.  So, I went back to the Ford dealer, picked out the truck I wanted and drove out of their dealership a happy camper!  The V6 twin turbo engine has PLENTY of power and is very quiet.  The ride is extremely comfortable and I love the rear camera for backing as I sometimes pull trailers.  My wife has a Toyota Highlander and wants to sell it and get an F150!  I have had excellent service with Toyota trucks, so I'll have to wait and see if Ford is their equal in build quality, but so far, I love my F150!Have now had my F150 for almost 10 months and have almost 23,000 miles on it and have had absolutely no problems.  I periodically tow a 2 axle flatbed trailer loaded with a tractor or a single axle trailer for my Harley and the V6 engine does a great job with no evidence of engine labor, and the backup camera is terrific!  Ford advertises this engine (3.5L V6) at 24 MPG highway, and I suppose you could get that, but you'd have to drive 50 MPH on flat ground at sea level to achieve achieve 24 MPG.  I think all of the manufacturers have a very mysterious way of calculating mileage, so judging mileage by the window sticker is, as they say, ""for comparison, as your actual mileage may vary"".  My only negative comment would be with the air conditioner;  I wish it were a bit colder.  Vehicle air conditioners were much better when they used Freon R-12, but under the government's false premise that R-12 depletes the ozone layer, we're stuck with the vastly inferior R-134.  The Ford A/C is probably no worse than any other, however.  All that said, I still love my F150!Update:  I now have almost 40,000 miles on my F150 and have had no real issues.  Now that the engine is broken in, the gas mileage has improved.  Every so often I have trouble pairing with my cell phone and it takes over an hour before it finally pairs.  Strange.   Because I bought the long bed version of my Super Crew cab, it is a bit more difficult to park in marked parking lots, but that's a decision I made based on stuff that I haul, so I accept that.  My wife, not so much.  Do I still love my F150?  Yep!"

Had a 2010 F150 Lariat before that was moderately loaded and was wishing for more. So after I had some equity in the truck we traded in for this puppy and our payments are nearly the same :).Driving these two vehicles in theory should have been the same (minus the engine. The Lariat had the 5.4 w/a 6-speed). Although they were virtually the same truck everything about the way they act is different under the assumption that the engine changes everything. Steering in the Platinum is waaaay more refined and the road noise on the vehicle is greatly reduced at highway speeds. The only thing about the truck I didn't like initially were the wheels... So I actually transferred the wheels from our old one to this one and it's actually a truck instead of a pimpmobile.Gas mileage is slightly poorer with the Ecoboost (14vs17 mixed mpg's) than with the 5.4 and I'm assuming it has to do with moving all that weight around. Also let's face it. When you're purchasing a truck of this magnitude you have to accept that mileage is going to be more on the poor side. However the pickup on this engine is remarkable and almost car-like so that more than makes up for it. 90% of the interior controls are digital with only volume, temp and some radio preset buttons having hard press keys. With a home menu that's set up.... ok, everything in the vehicle is easy to function and menu's are easily read and settings are easy...ish to change. occasionally you'll have to tap an option again as the 1st time it didn't register but this isn't to the point that it's frustrating.The power fold mirrors and back-up camera are options that are luxuries but not that I have them I don't know how I lived without them in my previous F-150. They make parking and maneuvering this beast a lot easier in a tighter parking lot and I have come to rely on them.  Right height is perfect and driving down the road it behaves very well, with all features working beautifully to keep you on the road in the more harsh ND winters.My family's favorite feature of the vehicle has to be all the heated/cooled seats. Being leather in ND this is something of a luxury and a first for us. everyone can now enjoy a warm tush on days where temps can get as low as -30F on the daily and with leather you can get pretty cold down there before things start to warm on in the vehicle.This is definitely a vehicle I can recommend and for one buying the same brand/model of vehicle twice hasn't let me down. Way to go Ford!

It's a full size truck and gets about 15 mpg at best most days and I assume that's about right for this. My first F150 was a '90 with a straight six and a stick and was getting around 20 mpg, but hey a v8 with automatic in a truck this size is gonna use more gas right?

I know that I'm driving a truck because of its aggressive stance and ride height, but sometimes the quietness and comfortable ride have me thinking I'm riding in a luxury sedan (i.e. Crown Victoria). The only downside is the sluggish feel of the throttle when accelerating. They say its because of the truck's weight, but the 5 star frontal crash rating should cancel that negative out. If I had it to do over again, I would buy mine with the 5.4 liter instead of the 4.6 liter. Overall this is a great truck!

I have 81,000 miles and have not had any mechanical problems. My truck has the 4.2L 6cyl engine. It's true what expert reviewers say about it not being a truck you'll burn out in. The 4.2L is for casual normal drivers. It has plenty of power for getting up to speed, and passes other vehicles fine on the highway. I have not towed with it but I have read the 4.2L has plenty of towing capacity. PROS: The 2008 model still looks like a modern new model. Although my truck is only 2WD it sits up real high so visibility is great. The cabin is very roomy. I also have a mid 90's F150 and the driver's door seems much further away and safer in my 2008. The ride is comfortable, and my gas mileage is not too bad. I don't mistreat my truck and it seems to preform well, maybe at least 20mpg. The model I have is just one up from the base cabin. I have the two regular doors and two smaller side doors that can open up if the main doors are open. This extra little door has a small window which is perfect for visibility when changing lanes. What I'm saying is there is no blind spot like the lowest base model with no extra door and small window to see through. If you look left on that model to change lanes you'll be staring at an interior rear cab column which will force you to lean forward to look out and back from the side window. There is no back bench seat on my model, just enough room for tool boxes, golf clubs, etc. It's substantial and not a tiny space behind the front row which I really like, although in hindsight I would prefer to have the larger back seating area with the fold down bench seat. CONS: The truck is awesome, but there are a few issues I need to address. The rake on the truck tilts forward, and rain collects in the bed of the truck. I regularly have to back the truck out of the driveway to lower the tail and let the water drain out. I think in the long run this could become a major problem for rust. I live in Arizona and the truck is rust free, but the winter rain and summer monsoons we get collects in the bed forward towards the cab....that is bad. There is a bed liner, but the factory bed liner has large access holes on the sides near the bottom. rain gets in there and I know the water is sitting. I'm actually afraid to take the bed liner off to see what has resulted. The A/C on my truck blows cold and the fan is great, but every time the A/C kicks on I can hear a slight squeal coming from the engine compartment. So far it has gone on for a couple years now and the A/C still works fine but I expect this will be a problem  in the future. The belt seems tight so this might be something for buyers to look for on used models. Some drink holders would have been nice on that fold down middle front seat which I keep down all the time. There is a retracting flimsy plastic double drink holder that comes out of the center of the dash, but it's cumbersome to use, and may not be usable for stick shift models. There is no AUX or USB on my model. If you want that you'll have to upgrade the stereo or buy a model that has it. REPAIRS: The only thing I have had to repair was the rear axle was slightly bent causing a vibration. I think that was from pulling out of parking lots and the rear right side skipping off the curb in tight situations. I treat my truck very well but a few times I've had the rear right side roll off the curb turning out into traffic. It only happened a few times so I was surprised to see the axle was bent. Runs smooth after my repair and I'm super careful now. SUGGESTIONS: Buy a F150 with power windows and door locks. If you have room in the garage get the model with the fold down rear bench because it adds so much more versatility. The reason I bought my truck with a 4.2L 6cyl is because I read a lot of great reviews on that engine, and it has a timing chain instead of the timing belt. The chain should last the lifetime of the truck. In Arizona it's common for trucks to go beyond 200,000+ miles so the timing chain is nice to have. My 1995 F150 has 170,000 rust free miles (4.9L 300ci 6cyl with timing chain).

It has 80,000 miles as if this review. There are two types of regular cabs. One that has no 3rd and 4th opening doors and one that does. I have the reg cab model that has the little side opening doors. You have to open the main doors and then the sides open up to add tools and stuff to store behind the front bench seat. It is awesome to have this. I only recommend having the little extra room like I have, or the larger capacity with fold down bench or the crew cab. The reason I suggest this is because the little side window that comes on those 3rd and 4th opening doors is crucial to being able to look through before changing lanes. Okay here is my review....this truck is pretty stout, and looks damn good. I also own a 1995 F-150 and the 2008 F150 is much larger, higher, and has a lot of room inside. The area between where you sit and the side of the door is further away than the older models so the engineers obviously had safety in mind when designing this model for side impact. The truck sits much higher than older models and gives you a commanding view of the road. The 4.2L V6 is plenty for what I need and gets really good gas mileage in my opinion. The auto trans w/ OD is nice for towing and also for city driving. I prefer auto trans on trucks because in some cases with manual you have to slide the seat forward too close to the airbag to engage the clutch. I did my research on the 4.2L V6 and it is bullet proof. It has the timing chain too so it should last the life of the truck. I don't want to talk trash about other engines offered during this time period so I will just leave you to do your own research. If you're a lead footed driver that likes to abuse your truck and race all over the place the 4.2L V6 is not going to give you that 0-60mph in 2 sec performance you seek. If you drive moderately and cruise 75-85mph on the freeway the 4.2L will do fine and still has plenty of power left to pass if you need to at those speeds. You'll drive past gas stations if you drive with any respect for your vehicle. I expect to get many miles out of my truck as it has performed great for me and still looks like a new model. Only complaint I have is the bed of the truck sits high and if you like to load and retrieve things from the side then you better be 6ft tall. UPDATE: I sold the truck. Not for any reason other than I still have a 95 F-150 that I am still very much attached. Be advised the 2008 F-150 did not lose value and I was able to get more than I paid very easily. If you maintain your F-150 it will hold its value and possibly even gain in value like mine did (if you buy it used). Cheers!

Has always been and continues to be a very smooth and quiet truck - more like a luxury car. Good stable handling as well. Lots of room inside and in the bed and great for towing and good in the snow. Mechanically has been very good. However, rust has been a relatively serious issue. The steering rack was the first to go - rusted out and got very stiff and erratic to steer. Had to replace that and was very rusty. The second was much more serious. The transmission cooling lines rotted out. They let go just after I got home from a long trip to Nova Scotia with my elderly father. There was fluid on the ground the day after I came home. We could have been stuck in the middle of the night in the middle of no where. We were fortunate, but cost me about $900 to fix. Checked the underside and there was a lot of rust on the frame and especially the bed rails. Not very happy about that. I've been spending a lot of time sanding, priming and painting the frame and rusty areas of the underside. I'm also using the 3M rust fighter undercoating as well. It's costing a lot of time and money, but I'm hoping it gives me a lot more years with the truck. Don't want another car payment! Looked at the underside of my wife's 2006 Toyota Sienna and noticed that it was undercoated from the factory and hardly any rust. Maybe Ford ought to consider that or they won't get any return buyers. If I get another truck, I'll be looking strongly at Toyota.

I am fine with the lower torque gears as I am not as prone to squealing my tires. I am not sure about any benefit in gas mileage. It is a truck, what would you expect?

Definately not my last F-150!

Current truck is KR F-150, fully-optioned. I have been impressed. Runs well, a little short on power, but really smooth and still torquey 5.4L engine. Frame and overall build integrity is very strong. Have tested and/or driven most of the competition and still,to me,Ford has the top overall offering for reliability and ""truck performance."" Still looks good; has stayed fresh in styling.  Some minor assembly issues which are being remedied at dealer; nothing major here. Not a diesel when towing but a great daily driver. Mileage acceptable at 16.5 combined--better than expected."

GMC truck is overall good, however, I don't like its small mirror. Dodge 4.7L engine has less gas mileage. HEMI engine has more power. Tundra is interesting. It labels 381 hp. However, its real world hp is simmilar to the 4.6L Ford I am buying. Toyota cheats new buyers that way. I am atruck person who only care real world hp, not hp on the paper.

Fuel economy cold be much better, and it is costly to drive these days, but as a owner of a single cab 02  V6 F150, then upgrading to this 5.4 V8, I can see that Ford did get better in its fuel economy, but hey, if you drive such a big truck, you better expect the gas to be high. I have noticed some things that i dont like about it, but all Fords at all dealerships had the problems, one being they roll back on a slope, the other being the steering wheel shakes a bit too much for my liking at speeds of about 70mph.

This car is an absolute BLAST to drive (top up or top down). I have always wanted a red Mustang convertible (my grandpa had a '64 1/2 baby blue Mustang coupe) and never thought I would be able to afford one. Not only is this car gorgeous, but it's AFFORDABLE!

I think its ultimate handling abilities exceed my willingness to explore them but when pushed through the twisties this car would probably put certain 2 seater sports cars to shame. With the 5 speed manual, the acceleration is outstanding and the incredible exhaust note under power makes the car a total blast to drive.

The silver paint job has stayed well, with good indoor parking care. The v6 is not the fastest off the block even with the manual. You probably won’t win any drag races however it has plenty of power and speed over 3000 rpms. I have had to repair the AC system twice and the battery once. Other than that it’s been pretty reliable. The power seats and heating have been meh. After 4 Years they gave way. I do love the inside console and the shaker music system.

Note also that I do an excellent job maintaining my vehicles.  At 100,000 miles, though, my Mustang first had a cracked exhaust manifold ($450.00).  A few months later it sprung two oil leaks in the transmission and wouldn't hold any oil ($350.00).  About two weeks later it wouldn't start one day (transmission shift cable - $215.00).  As I've read in other reviews, I have also experienced the engine vibration as I come to a stop at an intersection.  It's now got about 109,000 miles, so I can't really complain, (and I still like the car), but I'm wondering how much life it has until something major goes wrong.

This is my second Focus, and I can honestly say I cant complain about it at all. I'm middle aged so I don't need all the extra power, bells, and whistles. The fuel economy is excellent. Most of my driving is highway, and I average about 40.5 mpg. , less for city driving. The ride is comfortable especially for trips less than three hours. The car handles very well, and is quite nimble when getting into parking spaces. The 1.0 liter is adequate for my needs, but it lacks the power of my previous Focus which had the 2.0 . (By the way, the 2.0 also got great mileage). I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs a low cost, reliable sedan.

There is one caveat...  you have to be able to drive the car within it's range.  This probably isn't the car for you if you live in a cold climate, and you need to keep it plugged in if you live in a hot climate.  However, I would call this car a luxury car, and to drive a car of this quality every day I would easily spend 3 times as much in overall costs.Range...If you drive this like any other car, then your range will probably be 70 miles on an average day, but only around 45 miles at 32 degrees.  The great thing is that traffic actually increases your range.  I couldn't imagine a better car in traffic.  It is comfortable, quiet, and using the low range mode means you rarely have to touch the brake pedal.Battery...I just tested the battery, and after 2 years I have not had any loss.  The car has a cooling system on the battery.Maintenance/Repairs/Warranty...I have had no maintenance costs.  The car has been in the shop for 21 days in 2 years for work on the charging system.  However, I have a backup car so that has not been an issue.  The great thing is that the charging system/battery is warranted for 8 years/100k miles.  As long as you can deal with the car being in the shop periodically, then this isn't a problem.  Again, I look forward to 8 years of very low maintenance costs.Exterior...I love the exterior.  I have the white pearl paint, and the paint quality is very good.  I love Mazdas and Hondas, but their paint is notoriously bad and cheap.  It's nice to have good paint for a change.Interior...This is one of the nicest cars I have ever had.  The leather seats are of high quality, and it feels like a luxury car.  It is very quiet, and there is no emissions to breathe in.  Cargo space is very small due to the battery placement, but i love the fact that i can put items in the back without them sliding around.Ride...The ride and handling is very good.  The car is heavy, so it rides well, and the handling is very good.Performance...The  car is very slow off the line up to 5 miles an hour.  However, in real world driving most people to take off quickly from the line.  The car has a very smooth start.The rest of the time the performance is very good.  Acceleration is great once you have started, as the electric motor provides instant torque.  It is most impressive while going up a hill.  If I need to pass going up a hill, I am around the car in front of me before they have a chance to react (too many people like to speed up when you pass them :) ). Value...I got an amazing deal, as Georgia had the $5000 tax credit.  So, my effective price was only around $17500 with all the incentives.  I have had no costs at all for the car over two years (no oil changes), and with electricity so inexpensive my only significant cost is depreciation.  Depreciation has been steep with gas prices so low now, but the cars depreciation will be negligible over the next 3-4 years.Most people don't realize that the true cost to a car is not it's purchase price, but it's depreciation and repair costs.  We had a 2007 Acura TL type S and a 2003 VW Passat.  The Passat actually cost us twice as much as the Acura TL due to the poor depreciation of the VW and very high repair costs.  The Focus Electric has a high depreciation hit when you first buy it, but it is very low after that.Features...I love the auto start.  On a hot day I start it before we get in and it is so much cooler than any of the rest of our cars.The heated seats keep me warm on the days that are 60 degrees, so I don't use the heater that much.I love the low range.  I use it often in traffic, coming down hills, or going through traffic lights.  It slows you down without having to use the brakes, and the power is reclaimed through regeneration.Things you have to learn how to do...Keep it charged.  We have a backup car, so if we forget to charge it, it is not a big deal for us.  If you don't have a backup car that could be an issue.Keep it cool.  During the hot summer months, heat degrades the battery.  So keep it inside or plugged in.You probably will need a level 2 charger installed.

The next morning I woke up and checked the ""Very same car""   not to be so      they substituted a much cheaper model   over a 1000.00 cheaper       I drove to the dealership  and they refused to acknowledge this..   (oops I am a retired mechanic  had my own shop)   so off to small claims court    their attorney claimed they made a mistake   and pleaded with me to accept 1500.00   so they did not want to go in front of the judge.

The jerkiness made me crazy, especially in stop and go traffic.  I then received the recall notice about the software update for the transmission.  The first two days after I received it, it was worse, but after a couple of weeks it pretty much stopped which is what the dealership told me would happen.  The software update made a big difference and I also felt more comfortable putting my foot on the gas.   I had become hesitatant because I was afraid of the jerking.  I have since received the notice about the transmission extended warranty for 10 years or 150,000 miles.  I am still not 100% comfortable but felt better than I did in the beginning.  Other than the transmission issues, I have enjoyed driving the car. I like the phone Sync, being able to get Sirius.

In April, the transmission light and a message gave me 5 minutes to pull over. The message read that the car was overheating. Transmission message appeared. I was traveling up a hill off Laurel Canyon. You could hear the gears every time you drove up a hill. I was in bumper to bumper traffic. The car was also rolling backwards. I know how that feels because I know how to drive a stick. It was a very hot day. Which is a trigger for the transmission. We took the car back to Sunrise. First, we were told that it was a computer chip malfunction. A module message. They said don't worry about it. It's a common message. Then we were given an appointment to replace the clutch and seals. The appointment was so far out because they were backed up due to so many appointments to repair transmissions. We dropped the car off on June 14. They had the car for 4 days. While they had the car we ask them to fix the windshield wipers and the speaker panel. We notice that in the early part of July the dashboard was malfunctioning. I have photos. The gas hand wouldn't move and the gas numbers, mileage numbers, degrees, and radio stations were jumping all over the place. The AC stop working properly. A few days ago we were approached by Sunrise to buy back our car. He said that the car had built up equity. My husband asked him how is that possible because it hasn't been 6 months yet. They offer us a lower payment and interest. My husband said no because it's a buy back scam buy Ford. Last night the car started to jerk, it wouldn't get out of first gear. We got the car home. It wouldn't start nor reverse. We had to push the car into our parking spot. The transmission service light is on. The car was making a rumbling sounds even though it was turned off. We picked up the car on after they replaced the transmission again. Guess what? The Gear is locked. I found out from an auto fraud attorney that the Sunrise is suppose to disclose to customers the issues with the transmission. I was told by a lemon law attorney and the fraud attorney that the car will never run correctly. When we dropped our car off the second time for service we came across frustrated owners dropping off their car for repairs.
